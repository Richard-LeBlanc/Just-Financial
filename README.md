# Just Financial

Just Financial is a financial planning app for the developer's Systems Project class.
The class is meant to replicate the process of creating an app in an agile environment.


## Methodology:

1. Groups were formed and ideas for a project were generated.
    
2. Personas were created to describe our target demographics. 

3. Features of our financial planning app were ideated
    - Priority of said feature 
    - Feasibility given the deadlines
    - What is trendy in business now

4. Technology stack was decided on based on the features and constraints of the project

5. Design of the project using wireframes to decided how we wanted our webpage to be layed out

6. Mockup based on the initial wireframes to decide on final style choices and finalize lay out of the web application

7. Sprint planning for the coding of the application was agreed upon by the group members.
